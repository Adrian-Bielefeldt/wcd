single best value constraint (Q52060874) - items with a statement using the constrained property as predicate should only have one such statement with rank preferred

Violations:
	two distinct statements with the constrained property as predicate and preferred rank on the same item

Dependencies:
	all statements on an item with the constrained property and their rank

The single best value constraint requires that only one statement with the constrained property per item has the rank preferred.
It is violated if there are two or more statements on the same item with the constrained property and the rank preferred.
To model this one would need to count all statements with a specific property and rank preferred and output all items with more then one.
