citation needed constraint (Q54554025) - statements with the constrained property as predicate should have one or more references

Violations:
	statements with the constrained property as predicate and no references

Dependency:
	statements with the constrained property and all their references

The citation needed constraint states that a statement with the constrained property as predicate should have at least one reference.
It is violated by a statement with the constrained property but no reference.

Would not know how to implement this at the moment.
