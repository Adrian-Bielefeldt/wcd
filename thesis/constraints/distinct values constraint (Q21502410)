distinct values constraint (Q21502410) - two distinct statements with the constrained property as predicate should never have the same value

Violations:
	two distinct statements <subject> <constrained property> <value> with same values

Dependencies:
	statements with the constrained property as predicate

The distinct values constraint forbids the existence of two statements with the constrained property as predicate and the same value.
The necessary rule is:
	violation_long(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y) :- tripleEDB(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y), tripleEDB(OTHER_STATEMENT, Z, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y), unequal(STATEMENT, OTHER_STATEMENT)
