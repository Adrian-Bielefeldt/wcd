conflicts-with constraint (Q21502838) - items with a statement using the constrained property as predicate may not have certain statements or statements with certain properties

Qualifiers:
	conflicting property (P2306) - states the property the item may not have in a statement or in a statement with the conflicting values
	conflicting values (P2305) - optional - contains the values the item may not have in statements with the conflicting property as predicate

Violations:
	1) statements on items with the constrained property with the conflicting property
	2) statements on items with the constrained property with the conflicting property and one of the conflicting values

Dependencies:
	all statements on one item that has a statement with the constrained property as predicate

The conflicts with constraint forbids either certain statements or statements with a specific property on items with a statement using the constrained property as predicate.
The rules are:
	violation_long(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y) :- tripleEDB(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y), tripleEDB(OTHER_STATEMENT, X, conflictingPropertyConstant, Z)
and
	violation_long(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y) :-
		tripleEDB(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y),
		tripleEDB(OTHER_STATEMENT, X, conflictingPropertyConstant, conflictingValueConstant)
