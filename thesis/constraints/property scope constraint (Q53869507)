property scope constraint (Q53869507) - constrained property may only occur in the allowed 'position'

Qualifiers:
	property scope (P5314) - contains the allowed 'positions' for the property (as main value (Q54828448), as qualifier (Q54828449) or as reference (Q54828450))

Violations:
	statements in a position that is not allowed

Dependencies:
	statements, qualifiers and references with the constrained property as predicate

The property scope constraint specifies in which 'position' a property may be used as predicate. Since only three posibilities exist, this is equivalent to forbidding all other 'positions'.
The rules are thus dependent on the property scope.
If property scope does not contain as main value:
	violation_long(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y) :- tripleEDB(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y)
If property scope does not contain as qualifier:
	violations_short(STATEMENT, constrainedPropertyConstant, X) :- qualifierEDB(STATEMENT, constrainedPropertyConstant, X)
If property scope does not contain as reference:
	violations_short(STATEMENT, constrainedPropertyConstant, X) :- referenceEDB(STATEMENT, constrainedPropertyConstant, X)
