allowed qualifiers constraint (Q21510851) - qualifiers on a statement with the constraint property as predicate may only use certain properties

Qualifiers:
	allowed qualifier (P2306) - contains all properties that may appear as predicate of a qualifier

Violations:
	statement with the constrained property as predicate and a qualifier with a predicate different from all allowed qualifiers

Dependencies:
	statements with the constrained property and all their qualifiers

Allowed qualifiers constraint specifies that only a specific set of properties may be used as qualifiers on a statement with the constrained property.
Thus all statements with the constrained property that have one or more qualifiers with a predicate different from all allowed qualifiers are a violation.
The rule would be:
	violation_long(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y) :- tripleEDB(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y), qualifier(STATEMENT, PROPERTY, Z), unequal(<allowedQualifier>, PROPERTY)
with unequal(<allowedQualifier>, PROPERTY) for each allowed qualifier.
