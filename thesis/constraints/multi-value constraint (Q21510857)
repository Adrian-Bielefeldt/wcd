multi-value constraint (Q21510857) - items with a statement with the constrained property as predicate should have another statement with the constrained property

Violations:
	items with exactly one statement with the constrained property

Dependencies
		all statements on one item that has a statement with the constrained property as predicate

The multi-value constraint specifies that the constrained property should appear in multiple statements of an item. A violation is thus an item with exactly one statement using the constrained property.
The rules can be construced similar to the require pattern:
	require(STATEMENT, constrainedProperty)
for first and next as ususal, then:
	require_second(STATEMENT, constrainedProperty) :-
		next(PREVIOUS_STATEMENT, STATEMENT),
		next(PREVIOUSER_STATEMENT, PREVIOUS_STATEMENT)
		require(PREVIOUSER_STATEMENT, constrainedProperty),
		tripleEDB(STATEMENT, X, OTHER_PROPERTY, Y),
		unequal(constrainedProperty, OTHER_PROPERTY)
and
	require_second(STATEMENT, constrainedProperty) :-
		next(PREVIOUS_STATEMENT, STATEMENT),
		require_second(PREVIOUS_STATEMENT, constrainedProperty),
		tripleEDB(STATEMENT, X, OTHER_PROPERTY, Y),
		unequal(constrainedProperty, OTHER_PROPERTY)
which means the violations would be
	violation(X, constrainedProperty) :- require_second(STATEMENT, constrainedProperty), last(STATEMENT, X)
