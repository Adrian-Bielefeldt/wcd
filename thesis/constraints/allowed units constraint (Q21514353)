allowed units constraint (Q21514353) - a statement with the constrained property as predicate should only have specific units

Qualifiers:
	allowed unit (P2305) - contains the units that the statement may have

Violation:
	statements with the constrained property as predicate and a unit unequal to all allowed units

Dependencies:
	all statements with the constrained property as predicate and all unit [qualifiers]? on those

Allowed units constraint specifies that a statement with the constrained property as predicate may only have a unit that is in a set of specific units. Thus a violation is a statement with any other unit.
The rules would be:
	violation_long(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y) :- tripleEDB(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y), unit(STATEMENT, UNIT), unequal(<allowedUnit>, UNIT)
with unequal(<allowedUnit>, UNIT) for each allowed unit.
