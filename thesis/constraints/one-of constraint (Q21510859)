one-of constraint (Q21510859) - statements with the constrained property as predicate may only have specific values

Qualifiers
	allowed values (P2305) - contains all values that may be used by the property

Violations
	statements with the constrained property and values other than the allowed values

Dependencies
	statements with the constrained property as predicate

the one-of constraint limits the values a property may use. Any statement with the property and a value other than one of the allowed values is a violation.
The rule is:
	violation_long(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y) :- tripleEDB(STATEMENT, X, constrainedPropertyConstant, Y), unequal(<allowedValues>, Y)
with unequal(<allowedValues>, Y) for all allowed values.
