one-of qualifier value constraint (Q52712340) - qualifiers on statements with the constrained property as predicate with specific properties may only use specific values

Qualifiers:
	qualifier property (P2306) - the qualifier whose values are restricted
	qualifier values (P2305) - contains the values that are allowed for the qualifier

Violations:
	qualifiers on statements with the constrained property as predicate with the qualifier property and a value different from all qualifier values

Dependencies:
	statement with the constrained property and all qualifiers with the qualifier property

The one-of qualifier value constraint restricts which values may be used on a qualifier with the qualifier property on a statement with the constrained property as predicate.
A violation would thus be any statement with the constrained property and a qualifier with the qualifier property that has a value that is unequal to all qualifier values.
