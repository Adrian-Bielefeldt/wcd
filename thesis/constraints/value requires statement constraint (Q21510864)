value requires statement constraint (Q21510864) - values of a statement using the constrained property as predicate require a statement with another property on the same item; possibly with specific values
[should probably still write this, but it'll repeat the other thing. maybe explain it directly afterwards as requires constraint on the value, but violation is the constraint with the value]
