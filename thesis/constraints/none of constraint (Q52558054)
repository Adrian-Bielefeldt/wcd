none of constraint (Q52558054) - constrained property may not have specific values
Qualifiers:
	forbidden value (P2305) - values that may not be object of a triple having the constrained property as predicate

Violations:
	statements with the constrained property as predicate and a forbidden value as object

Dependencies:
	statements with the constrained property as predicate

The none of constraints restricts the values that the property may refer to. Every property with the none of constraint needs one or more values listed as forbidden.
There is no restriction placed on what these values are, this is specified via one of constraint (Q21510859) or type constraint (Q21503250).
The violations for this constraint are single statements and depend only on themselves, meaning each statement can be checked individually, independant of all others.
A triple subject predicate object constitutes a violation of this constraint if it has the constrained property as predicate and one of the forbidden values as object.
The rule modeling is:
	violation_long(STATEMENT, X, propertyConstant, Y) :- tripleEDB(STATEMENT, X, propertyConstant, confValueConstant)
for each constrained property in combination with all its forbidden values. Alternatively one could model:
	forbidden_value(propertyConstant, confValueConstant)
for all forbidden property-value combinations and find violations via:
	violation_long(STATEMENT, X, propertyConstant, Y) :- tripleEDB(STATEMENT, X, PROPERTY, Y), forbidden_value(PROPERTY, Y)
but this would result in a larger sum of facts and rules.
